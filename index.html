                Hello Della,<br />
                I hope you are doing well. This is my first attempt at
                writing something for Valentine's Day, so please spare me
                the critics. I'm neither a writer nor a literature lover
                like you, but I love when you tell me about the books you
                are reading and how cringy the romance is or how they just
                started banging in 60 pages. You have become a very special
                part of my daily life, and I can't even imagine how this was
                not my life not so far ago. We started off with a random
                late-night conversation, neither of us expecting that
                something so small would lead to us as of today. And then
                the talks started, and I got to know, and my god the
                similarities. Like, can you imagine?
                <br />
                Is this for real?
                <br />
                Really?
                <br />
                Like how is this even possible?
                <br />
                How do we have so much in common yet we are so different?
                <br />
                I can't even wrap my head around it. But I'm very grateful
                for it.
                <br /><br />
                Well, talking about us, we did go through some ups and
                downs, sometimes as small as a pebble on a road to sometimes
                as big as to create a wall between us. But yet here we are
                together, and it's just the start. I swear I'm thinking so
                hard to write it right now but guess what......... I can't
                think hehe, but ig it's better to not use my head and just
                write whatever coz guess what, you have made me feel
                comfortable enough that I can just be. And I hope that I
                make you feel the same way. I want to say I love you day
                after day, I want to hear it back from you, I want to see
                you someday, see you in person, talk to you in person, enjoy
                more music with you, and just wanna be with you.
                <br /><br />
                P.S: I don't know what I'm high while writing on maybe it's
                you. I don't even know if the flow makes sense, but I just
                wrote whatever came to me while writing.
